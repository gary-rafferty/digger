## Finds Facebook posts that you kinda remember seeing before

This is a WIP, but essentially, I sometimes remember seeing a post from
a friend on Facebook but have no idea how long ago it was. So the
problem is that I have no way of finding this post.

DiGGer aims to solve that problem by providing a way to search through a
users' posts and select those that match a given query.

### Dets

Uses Sinatra, MongoDB, Redis, Handlebars.js, jQuery, Sass, Bourbon &
Neat. Lots of cool shit.

### Todo

Write some tests. Pref MiniTest.
Check is Redis hash exists and action accordingly.
Style the Handlebars template.
Allow searching of multiple users.
Show some sort of spinner as searches can take a while.
Further lookback in history
